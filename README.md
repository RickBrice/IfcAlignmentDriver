# IfcAlignmentDriver

This is an application to facilitate playing with IfcOpenShell and hopefully develop support for IfcAlignment, IfcLinearPlacement, linear referencing, etc..

I have my project setup on in `F:\IfcAlignmentDriver`. 

The following environment variables are used in the compiler and linker settings:
- `$(BOOSTDIR)` = F:\IfcOpenshell\_deps\boost_1_79_0
- `$(IFCOPENSHELL_DIR)` = F:\IfcOpenshell
